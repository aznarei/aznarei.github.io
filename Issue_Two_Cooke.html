                        <p>Greta had heard of him through her friend Betsy, who liked him so much that she had given out his card to all her friends as an early Christmas gift; when she gave it to Greta, she warned that he didn’t appreciate that people had more enjoyable things to do than therapy. “He’ll take over your life. Still—completely brilliant. Went to Oxford, you know; first and everything. Brilliant. Practically insane, too, but ah, <i>c’est la vie.”</i></p>
                        <p>Betsy, a divorcée, was too restless to enjoy speed dating and therefore engaged in the more energetic practice (to her, anyway) of speed-therapy, out of which she derived much pleasure and little self-improvement. She had also never studied French, but liked to throw in French phrases whenever she could; Greta (who had) was a good enough friend to let her.</p>
                        <p>Unsurprisingly, Miles Agost spoke French, too, and it was in French that he began their first session, which Greta had scheduled out of curiosity. <i>“Bonjour, ma cherie!”</i></p>
                        <p>“Mr. Agost. Please.”</p>
                        <p>He settled into his massive armchair by the fire and beamed, looking like the Buddha statue behind him. “Call me Miles.”</p>
                        <p>Greta, sitting opposite him on an only slightly less plush armchair, threaded her fingers together and made a cage of them. “Alright.”</p>
                        <p>His smile faltered, and he paused for a moment, rubbing a veined hand over his chin as he looked at the cage of Greta’s hands. “Quite the sculpture you have there. Post-modern, I feel—a touch of Duchamp, no doubt.”</p>
                        <p>“I’m not familiar.”</p>
                        <p>“My God, woman, <i>Duchamp</i>! A genius of the highest order—placed a urinal in public, violated the ideas we as a primitive, conservative society have of what counts as art—the interaction of Man, the Consumer, and Man, the spirit.” He was in ecstasy at the full height of his power as Miles Agost, the man who knew everything and still felt the need to prove himself. “Duchamp—” a deep, lustful sigh— “loathed the individual in art; without others, the art was nothing.” He paused, frowning into space, as if disappointed by what he saw. “God knows why the man wanted to play chess.”</p>
                        <p>“Maybe he just wanted to be alone,” she suggested. Miles sat back in his chair and observed her.</p>
                        <p>“Is this your first time in therapy?”</p>
                        <p>“Yes.”</p>
                        <p>“Mmm, good, good.” Without taking his gaze off her, he sent his hand out across the armchair to the small table right beside him, where he kept a small pack of cards and an ivory pipe. Miles’ office—like Miles himself—was a self-conscious mixture of cultures, personal inclinations, and ostentatious display, best demonstrated by the fact that he had placed a photograph of himself shaking hands with the Dalai Lama above the mantelpiece. Greta wondered briefly what His Holiness would think of her current situation.</p>
                        <p>Miles’ hand snatched up the pipe and retreated back to the armchair, where it dropped the pipe and then, after travelling upwards to his cardigan pocket, began fumbling for matches. “How is your art these days?”</p>
                        <p>Startled, Greta collapsed the cage of her hands. “My art?”</p>
                        <p>“That’s the only reason I took you on, my dear. Ms. Klein—” as he called Betsy— “couldn’t stop bragging about her ‘<i>dear</i> friend Greta, simply genius, you know, a real jewel of the art world; ten Degas’, don’t you know, used to sculpt herself, quite the talent.’” The pipe lingered as an afterthought on the corner of his mouth.</p>
                        <p>“Betsy is sweet,” she said, looking down at her hands. “But horribly addicted to lying.”</p>
                        <p>“I wouldn’t say so. Ms. Klein was in raptures about one particular painting— of which you have many, I understand, portraits?” He paused here, having arrived at the point, and folded his hands neatly, as if satisfied by the way in which he had chosen to reach it.</p>
                        <p>She knew the painting he was talking about, of course; practically everybody who knew her did—not out of her own telling, but of others. They claimed it was beautiful, haunting, but Greta knew beautiful and Greta knew haunting, and didn’t understand how they could exist in the same thing. “Yes,” she sighed, cursing Betsy for having such a loud mouth. “I paid my way through art school. Small jobs, really. A couple portraits here and there to make ends meet.”</p>
                        <p>Miles frowned. With the pipe, his moustache, and lined eyes, he bore a faint resemblance to a basset hound that had been promised food and was instead given an empty bowl. “Ah, that common American colloquialism: <i>make ends meet</i>. Horrifying, really—consider, that is how all Americans view art, as moving towards an end.” He shook his head in disgust and tapped his pipe against his chair as he continued his musings. “Now, of course, your paintings would be quite the commodity. A critique on the capitalist nature of society, you know, the horrific intersection of commerce and the artiste. <i>C’est un dommage—</i>” a slam of his fist—“A pity, Ms. Cohen. A true pity.” His eyes widened, and he glanced skyward, as if praying for patience, before returning his gaze to hers.</p>
                        <p>Greta was beginning to understand why Betsy liked him so much; they both had a flare for making their lives a solo performance. “They were just paintings,” she offered, thinking of those days in the studio, when her hair had smelled like turpentine and everything had seemed stained with the anticipation of youth. Now, she did not paint, or sculpt, or do anything of kind; she lived quietly, cleanly. She took pains to ensure that her hair did not smell.</p>
                        <p>“Just paintings!” Miles cried, his eyes bugging out. “<i>Mon dieu</i>, Ms. Cohen, that is ridiculous. Look at the masters—take Degas, for example.”</p>
                        <p>Greta nodded, more out of an attempt to rid herself of these thoughts than to agree with him; he, however, took it as encouragement and launched into a lecture on Degas. As it was winding down, he took up his pipe and, leaning forward, confided, “Personally, I find ballet disgusting, but the man was clearly onto something, with all those plaster girls. Imagine that your life can be captured like <i>that</i>,” he said, slamming his fist for emphasis. “You are alive and dead all at once.”</p>
                        <p>It was, Greta conceded, an interesting idea.</p>

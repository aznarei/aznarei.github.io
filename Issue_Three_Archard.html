                        <br>i. Lady of the Lake
                        <br>He tells me he fell through the ice once and when I ask him how deep he tells me about fish who still wear legs and polliwogs thin as rice pushing through his mouth. He tells me he trawled bones like ice chips, wet overalls strung about him like cornsilk, the rubber soles of his shoes sounding the bottom. Above the loam huskies fought over a wet bone and he was lifted by his teeth to the white air, laid out naked in the back of a rusty sled. Then he was only thirty, and now ground to carapace he fogs the thick window, and the trolley rolls on through the snow. Outside, bootless girls walk on the water with flashlights and do not know that we are watching. From below milfoil weeds sing soft the felled pines and lace necked bodies and only the ice can hear.
                        <br>
                        <br>ii. Pulpit Rock
                        <br>To kill buffalo they burned sap fires here, sweet and crackling like pine syrup ‘til the herd showed their white eyes and bolted like fawns over the cliff face. The quick gravity of heavy things still hangs here with the far tilted conifers, and children in their plaid swimming suits have learned to be fearful of low squatting rock shelves. They fall like plucked berries against the shimmering water, careful to jump outwards-not-up and land with splashes too small for their bodies. Always we hold our breaths ‘til their brown heads bob again to the surface. To us, they seem like whinnying calves, but unlike buffalo we fear we do not know how to smell the smoke.

                        <b>Tick</b>
                        <br>
                        <br>&nbsp;   I feel like slow curdling milk. The kind of milk that rises like minced icebergs after being put in the microwave, and briefly the girl in her oversized YMCA nightshirt considers drinking me anyway but at the end of the night I am in the disposal with the old green peppers and lemon peels.
                        <br>&nbsp;   If ticks could speak they would have only four words: grass, tick, un-tick, and heat, and I wonder if they are happy in this alphabet of legs the way that I am not with all my home and self and the words that mean big changes.
                        <br>&nbsp;   If I could be a fat tick I would not need to be milk. On the girl’s left ankle I could climb like a lit up sponge and die all full of blood, eggs spilling like loose powder from a pouty makeup brush across the oriental carpet, sated with dog hair.
                        <br>&nbsp;   And on the inside of a vacuum cleaner, when I am dead, I could tell all the straw stinkbugs about the merengue fridge light and prismed beads of soap and most of all of grass and tick, un-tick and heat.

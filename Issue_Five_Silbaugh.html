                        <p>The parking lot is deserted. Way over on the other side, across the ocean of open spaces, Olivia can see a streetlamp puddled in yellow. It’s hard to remember the last time she sat like this with her brother -- side-by-side and alone. Jonas received his learner’s permit only a week ago, and their father took them to the grocery store parking lot so he could practice. If there were other cars here, Olivia knows, her dad wouldn’t have agreed to walk down the block to a Starbucks, to let Olivia help Jonas with his three-point-turns.</p>
                        <p>“Be careful,” her father says, because he misses taking care of her.</p>
                        <p>“Of course we’ll be careful,” she says. “Don’t worry.” </p>
                        <p>She takes him as he stands outside the car window: his blue fleece, the silver swirling out from his temples. She remembers a picture that stood on the mantlepiece before her parents separated -- her dad on their honeymoon, looking out over the orange horizon. Olivia’s mother, behind the camera, had coaxed a smile out of him, but the general air of the photograph was pensive and quiet. She hasn’t seen the picture for a long time.</p>
                        <p>Craning over the steering wheel with the caution of a beginner, Jonas pushes the key into the ignition. The thrum of the engine fills up the darkness.</p>
                        <p>“Okay,” she directs, “Why don’t you park in one of the spots by the curb? We’ll start practicing there and then move around a little.”</p>
                        <p>It is the first time Olivia has been in her dad’s car since she started college. All the other times when she’s come back home for a holiday, her mother has taken Olivia and Jonas to their dad’s apartment, dropping them off in front and then picking them up again a few hours later. But her mother is going out tonight, with a violist from the orchestra, and so their dad picked them up from her house. When they saw his car, Olivia and Jonas had collected their things and gone outside to greet him; their mother stayed behind the screen, watching to make sure they got in before she closed the door. Seeing her, Olivia’s dad tooted the horn once and gave a small, perfunctory wave before turning out onto the street. Olivia thought how odd this was -- a relationship of seventeen years reduced to a single honk and wave.</p>
                        <p>It is Columbus Day weekend. Olivia hardly ever comes home for these short vacations. Flying is expensive, and ever since her parents’ divorce, going back to Boston is almost more exhausting than it is relaxing. But Aaron has a big psych test on Wednesday, and he’s almost failing so he needs to study. Besides, Olivia’s mother confided, she is worried about Jonas. He has always been quiet, but lately, she said, he seems almost reclusive, practicing for hours in the basement and then retreating to his room to play on his computer.</p>
                        <p>Jonas is in high school now. In September, her mother e-mailed Olivia a picture of him on his first day of school. Nearly three years have passed since Olivia’s high school days, and already she can feel her memories softening, sneakers blurring into green locker doors, the clear shards of memory becoming few and far between. She was so different then, wearing headbands and pastel cardigans, spending hours each night studying her notes from biology, a subject that she now remembers little about, a subject that, in fact, Jonas is taking this year. He is taller than her now. He has become thinner, too -- when Olivia hugged him at the airport, she could feel the bones in his shoulders through his sweatshirt. Now, he obeys her instruction, steering the car over into one of the spaces along the edge.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>“Okay,” Olivia says. “For three-point-turns, we have to pretend we’re on a street. This is one curb, obviously, and let’s say the other one is, um...over there, where the second row of spaces starts. Okay? We’re on a street.”</p>
                        <p>"Yup, on a street,” Jonas repeats, nodding quickly, the way he does when he’s nervous. Olivia wonders whether it’s about the driving or whether maybe he is feeling the same nerves that she is -- being alone together, trying to remember when they were easy together. Olivia looks at his hands, holding the steering wheel -- those fingers, as long and straight as if they were carved out of wood. “The hands of a true musician,” her mother used to say often, oblivious in these moments to Olivia, whose hands were average-looking and who, her mother had at last agreed, didn’t have a knack for violin, flute, or piano. It was a great relief at the time, knowing that she would never again have to sit in one of the gray-carpeted practice rooms, trying to force melodies out of things far too concrete and bulky while her mother looked on and sighed.</p>
                        <p>But when Jonas turned four and asked to play the cello, Olivia’s mother was ecstatic, and from then on Olivia couldn’t help feeling that she’d come up short somehow. It is difficult to be around them when the conversation turns to music, as it often does. It is like they both know a language that she does not.</p>
                        <p>Olivia never had a gold-star talent like that. Not like Jonas’s cello-playing. Sometimes, seeing the audience ripple with applause for him, it is impossible not to feel a rush of envy.</p>
                        <p>Maybe, Olivia thinks, this is why her favorite memories of Jonas were often when he was sleeping; then he finally seemed like her little brother. She remembers the long road trips they used to take to go visit their cousins. Jonas would go to sleep as soon as they got on the highway, leaning over onto her lap. She remembers being totally transfixed -- his torso rising and falling, his lips popping quietly.</p>
                        <p>Maybe that’s why she gets along so much better with her dad. The two of them are simpler than Jonas and her mother, less interesting, less cultured and clever. Maybe that’s why it was so surprising when Aaron asked her out. It was thrilling to think that a boy who plays the bass guitar and almost-flunks classes would like someone as normal as Olivia.</p>
                        <p>“Turn on your left flasher,” she says to Jonas, and he obeys. “Awesome. Now drive over to the other curb but stop before you hit it. A little sharper -- you want to end up perpendicular with the road.”</p>
                        <p>She looks over at her brother, his eyebrows lowered in concentration. He does seem more serious than he did the last time she visited. “He just seems so sad,” her mother reiterated to Olivia the day before, as she chopped a zucchini for dinner. “I started taking him to a psychiatrist a couple months ago, so now he’s on Prozac and he has an appointment every week. But he never wants to talk about it with me. I just don’t know what’s going on.”</p>
                        <p>The sound of the knife clunking on the wooden cutting board was sadly familiar -- it is a noise Olivia remembers from her childhood. She remembers playing with Jonas on the family room floor, only subconsciously aware of the noises from the kitchen: conversation, laughter; their mother cutting things; the faucet turned on; the fridge sucking open as their dad reached in for a beer.</p>
                        <p>But she didn’t have any advice for her mother. “I don’t know,” she said. “Maybe just give him some time.” That was what her friend Kasey had told her, months ago, back when they still talked about Aaron. Just give him some time. It was all she could think of.</p>
                        <p>Olivia wonders if maybe Jonas is just a quiet kind of person. Even when they were kids, he never minded being by himself.  Together at their grandparents’ house in Vermont, Jonas and Olivia made up a game called “police,” creeping through the rustling woods with sticks over their shoulders like guns. When Olivia turned 10 and told Jonas that she had outgrown “Police,” he didn’t whine and sulk, as she secretly hoped he would. Instead, he just played the game by himself, acting out both parts and looking like he was having just as much fun as when she played too.</p>
                        <p>Jonas steps on the brake just before they reached the imaginary curb, throwing Olivia forward in her seat a little.</p>
                        <p>“Sorry,” he says.</p>
                        <p>She forces a smile. “That’s okay. All right, so now you want to turn the car a little as you back up. Use your left hand, there we go. Okay, from here it’s easy.”</p>
                        <p>He finishes the turn.</p>
                        <p>“So how’s school?” she asks.</p>
                        <p>“Fine.” He pauses. “I have Mrs. Juniper for math.”</p>
                        <p>Olivia laughs, an image of Mrs. Juniper flashing to mind. Rosy-cheeked, a little pudgy, hair always held up with colorful barrettes. Still functioned under the misconception that she was young enough to sit on top of her desk and swing her stockinged legs, to ask her students what the ‘word on the street’ was.</p>
                        <p>“Oh my god, I remember her. Does she still talk about her blind dates?”</p>
                        <p>“All the time. I think maybe she’d have better luck if she ditched the orange sweaters.”</p>
                        <p>They both laugh, and Olivia can feel the distance between them closing a little bit.</p>
                        <p>“And cello? How’s that?”</p>
                        <p>“It’s good.” He looks at her oddly, seems to pull back, like he isn’t sure why she’s asking.</p>
                        <p>Mom says you’re seeing a psychiatrist, she wants to say. Are you okay? How are things going? But she can’t manage to choke the words out. </p>
                        <p>“Drive over there, by that streetlamp,” she says instead. “We’ll practice some more of those turns.”</p>
                        <p>He sits upright as he drives, holding the steering wheel firm in his hands and making small, tight corrections. Olivia’s mother, similar to Jonas in most other ways, can’t understand this quietness that he has, this precision, as he cuts the car across the parking lot in a perfect line. Usually, Olivia is the one who takes after their dad, but in his quietness, Jonas is more like their father.</p>
                        <p>Olivia and Jonas will spend tomorrow with their mother. Then on Sunday, they will see their dad again. Jonas seems used to all of this switching between houses, to the packing and unpacking of toiletries and clothes, but to Olivia it still feels like a foreign game. She was already out of the house when her parents separated, and it was Jonas who first told her that her dad was staying with friends from work. She remembers that her first emotion was anger -- that they told him before they told her.</p>
                        <p>When she came home during those first months, before her dad found a place of his own, Olivia saw him only for an hour or two on the weekends, at museums or restaurants. Eventually, he found a fourth-floor suite in an old brownstone downtown, with a sunny sitting room and a wrought iron balcony that looked out over a small dog park. It was strange to see her dad fill the rooms with furniture of his own -- broad sofas and simple beds, big framed maps and black-and-white prints. Their mother stayed in the house where Olivia and Jonas grew up, with its oriental rugs and hardwood floors, the magnets on the fridge, the room in the basement where she gave clarinet lessons. Little changed there -- the only large things her dad took with him were his dresser and his stereo and his elliptical. The lawn was cut less neatly than when her dad did it, and the stack of papers on the kitchen desk became even messier without him there to shuffle it neat, to nag Olivia’s mother about going through it with him. But these were small details -- things that an outside eye would find hard to discern.</p>
                        <p>Aaron doesn’t understand Olivia’s parents’ relationship at all. The one time she opened up to him about it, after a particularly strained Thanksgiving weekend last year, he hardly seemed to care.“That’s rough, Liv,” he said. “Did one of them cheat?”</p>
                        <p>“No,” she said. “It was mutual.”</p>
                        <p>“If it makes you feel any better, my parents are split, too,” he said. “My dad ran off with some girl from the gym,” he said, leaning forward to kiss her. But it didn’t really feel like good kissing. It felt more like he was trying to shut her up.</p>
                        <p>They arrive on the far edge of the parking lot.</p>
                        <p>“What should I do now?” Jonas asks her. </p>
                        <p>“Same thing as before. We’re just going to try it again, but see if you can remember the steps this time.”</p>
                        <p>He drives away from the streetlamp, stops before he hit the yellow line of paint.</p>
                        <p>“Really,” Olivia insists. “How are things going?” She touches the stud in her nose, the tiny pebble of metal, and then returns her hand to her lap. She got it pierced a few months ago, at Aaron’s urging. The drummer in his favorite band has a nose ring -- she is tough, sexy, and, Olivia privately thinks, a little scary. Both of her parents asked her about it, and she’d been vague. “It didn’t hurt at all,” she lied. “And I really wanted it. I went with a friend.” </p>
                        <p>“They’re okay.”</p>
                        <p>She raises her eyebrows. “Really?”</p>
                        <p>He puts the car into reverse, looks over his shoulder, backs up.</p>
                        <p>“Yeah, sure. Why wouldn’t they be?”</p>
                        <p>“Well, you know...Mom and Dad,” she says obliquely. He shrugs, and so Olivia takes a deep breath. Her heart is beating really fast. She pictures herself and Jonas as two trains on a track, approaching, waiting for the inevitable crash. The only way to end this waiting, she thinks, this painful suspension, is to speed up and do it herself. “Mom says you’re on Prozac.”</p>
                        <p>His eyes brighten with surprise for a second before the indignation sets in. “What? She told you that?”</p>
                        <p>Olivia flusters. “Well, uh. You know, I mean, it just came up --”</p>
                        <p>“Really. When did she tell you?”</p>
                        <p>The car is moving too fast, it seems, and Jonas is moving too slow. His head turns to her like a white moon.</p>
                        <p>“It doesn’t matter --”</p>
                        <p>“No, I want to know. When?”</p>
                        <p>In her side mirror, Olivia can see the lamppost approaching like a big metal arm. “Watch out!” she says, but it’s too late. The car crunches into the steel lamppost, and Olivia feels her body slam backward onto the seat.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>The engine is still running, but Jonas doesn’t really notice it because his heart is beating so loudly. Olivia’s hand reaches over, cranks the key until the noise goes off. The parking lot is too quiet, like it is sealed in a jar. </p>
                        <p>“Well, shit,” Olivia says, tugging at her lip with her teeth. She opens her door, lets it hang there for a second, and then she gets out and walks behind the car to take a better look. Through the rearview mirror, Jonas can see that the trunk is folded neatly around the pole.</p>
                        <p>“Come here,” Olivia says, and so he does. The air is cold and silky in the way that it only is in early October. </p>
                        <p>“Can you squeeze under the car and take a look at the wheels?”</p>
                        <p>He inches his way underneath and looks up at the car belly, a labyrinth of gray tubes that look like intestines. None of it means anything. Fuck fuck fuck, he thinks. He can’t believe he did this.</p>
                        <p>“I’m not sure,” he says to Olivia. “I really don’t know.”</p>
                        <p>There’s a pause, and then he can hear that she is talking on the phone, probably to one of their parents, but he can’t make out any of the words. The blur of the conversation reminds him of the road trips they used to take when he and Olivia were younger, from Boston to Baltimore, where their cousins lived. They would drive until late at night, sometimes, and Jonas remembers that he would lean his head on Olivia’s lap and she’d cradle his shoulder with her hand. It was the best way to fall asleep, listening to the murmur of their parents’ conversation from the front. Often, lying in his own lonely bed late at night, Jonas wishes that he could conjure up that scene.</p>
                        <p>He slides out from under the car, gravel scraping his palms. “Fuck,” he says aloud, and takes a moment of brief pleasure in the metallic clicking of the word. “Fuck fuck fuck.” He pictures his parents’ reactions: his mother, face red, eyes flashing, repeating herself, shaking her head. His father, running his hands through his hair like he can’t believe it, followed by that cool and disappointed silence.</p>
                        <p>His mom, Jonas knows, will want to blame people. She’ll start with Jonas himself: “You have to be careful!” she will say. “I don’t know what I would do if something happened to you.” Then maybe she’ll soften a little, saying, “I’m a musician, too, you know. I know what it’s like to be absentminded. We just have to be more careful.” She does that often; pulls the “we musicians” card as a way of bonding with him. People are always saying how alike Jonas and his mom are: because of their dark eyes, straight bangs, quiet voices -- but mostly, he knows, because they both play music. Sometimes he can’t help wondering. If he hadn’t stumbled into cello, would people still say that? </p>
                        <p>One time Jonas remembers coming into the basement to ask his mom a question while she was giving a clarinet lesson. The door to her studio was open an inch, and he could see his mom’s back. “I know it’s difficult,” she was saying. “But you have to make it easy. Music is the easiest thing in the world if you just lean a little. Let yourself relax.” Jonas knew exactly what she meant. He had returned upstairs without asking his question -- it was better, he thought, that she didn’t know he heard. Now often when he practices he finds those words floating through his mind: “Let yourself relax.” He never knew the right way to say it before.</p>
                        <p>“I’m sorry,” he hears Olivia saying outside the car. “Yes, I’m sorry, I’m sorry. Geez!”</p>
                        <p>He is almost more worried about facing his father. It is obvious how proud of Olivia his father is. He doesn’t say so, of course, but his actions speak. When Olivia was in high school, he came to every one of her softball games; he printed out her report cards and hung them on the refrigerator; he laughed hard at her jokes, even the inappropriate ones. Jonas still remembers how envious it made him -- a feeling unfurling in his stomach like a vine.</p>
                        <p>The previous Sunday, Jonas and his father tried throwing a frisbee back and forth in the dog park behind the apartment, but after twenty minutes of Jonas’s short throws and fumbling catches, his father had sighed and called it quits. It seems like that’s often his dad’s attitude towards Jonas: resignation and quiet disappointment.</p>
                        <p>His mother seethes, his father retreats. That is the way they are. Olivia doesn’t understand it; she was gone by the time they split. Sometimes it feels like she isn’t even part of the family, really -- just a familiar-faced cousin who comes to stay every now and then. His parents change when she comes, the way they used to when Aunt Cynthia and Uncle Myron visited. His mom gets up earlier in the mornings, dressed and in the kitchen making eggs when Jonas comes downstairs. His father makes an effort, too. He buys the kind of cranberry juice Olivia likes and tries to start conversations more.</p>
                        <p>Outside, Jonas can hear that Olivia is still on the phone. When he hears her say, “okay, bye,” he pushes his door open and gets out of the car.</p>
                        <p>“Did you call Dad or Mom?” he asks.</p>
                        <p>“Both,” she says. “First Dad, but then I knew Mom would freak if I didn’t tell her. You know how she is. They’re on their way.” She pauses and tilts her head. “I think you must have hit the accelerator by mistake as you were backing up, because we’re crunched in pretty well. I’m, um, not even sure Dad’ll be able to drive this thing.”</p>
                        <p>He puts his face in his hands again.</p>
                        <p>“Don’t worry,” Olivia says. “I don’t think it was really your fault.” She looks up at the sky and he follows her gaze. The sky is clear and the stars look sharp somehow, like they could cut you. “Let’s listen to some music.” She reaches into her sweatshirt pocked and pulls out her iPod. “Want to check and see if Dad has a cup in the car?”</p>
                        <p>It is a trick she taught him long ago -- putting an iPod in an empty cup or bowl to amplify the sound. She knows all sorts of other tricks, too. That you can bend a spoon back and forth until the silver gets all soft in the middle. That bananas are less yucky if you freeze them first. </p>
                        <p>But the cup trick is the best. They used to keep a blue plastic bowl in her room for that exact purpose, and Jonas remembers spending many nights sitting there with her, trying to drown out the noise of their parents arguing downstairs. Olivia always knew just the right thing to do in those situations: that listening to music would help, and so would cracking the window to hear traffic outside, and so would leafing through old volumes of Calvin &amp Hobbes in the semidarkness. One time last year, he went in her room to listen to some music when he couldn’t fall asleep. But it wasn’t the same without her there.</p>
                        <p>Sure enough, there is a slightly crunched plastic cup in the glove compartment. Jonas takes it and stepped back outside. </p>
                        <p>“I’m up here,” Olivia calls, and he looks up to see her lying on her back on the roof of  the car, arms bent into triangles behind her head. He feels that familiar pit of admiration for her: that she is the kind of person who can climb on top of a car without thinking twice; who can ace a test without studying at all; who can skip school to go sledding, as she did one winter day in her senior year, without feeling any regret. Olivia will never have to take pills or see a shrink. It’s like the answers to life, to happiness, just come flashing out at her in perfect neon clarity.</p>
                        <p>“Come on up,” she said. “Use the back bumper as a step.”</p>
                        <p>He hoists himself up, the car creaking a little as it takes his weight. He stretches out next to her and puts her iPod into the cup. He starts scrolling through towards Simon and Garfunkel, which is what they always used to listen to together, but Olivia reaches forward and tilts it towards herself. “My friend introduced me to this band,” she says, playing a different song instead, one he doesn’t know. It sounds sharp and a little tinny, like barbed wire. Jonas knows she didn’t mean it meanly, but he feels a little sting of nostalgia anyway, that things can’t be like they used to. </p>
                        <p>They lie there and listen for a while.</p>
                        <p>Her voice cuts into the darkness. “Do you think I should call myself Olive?” she asks him. “I kind of like it. It’s got an edge to it that Olivia doesn’t.”</p>
                        <p>“What do you mean an edge?”</p>
                        <p>“I don’t know. I just think Olivia’s kind of boring, don’t you?”</p>
                        <p>You hate olives, he wants to say, even though he knows that isn’t the point. He wants to say, you are the least boring person ever. People know me because I play the cello; people know you because you’re Olivia and you’re awesome and confident and bold and funny. I’d give anything for that, really I would. But he doesn’t say that. He doesn’t have Olivia’s boldness, to break into things like that.</p>
                        <p>Instead, he looks at her, at her long nose and her squarish lips and her tank top with tiny holes cut down the sides. He wonders when she became the kind of person who needs to be named after a Mediterranean vegetable in order to feel like she has an ‘edge.’</p>
                        <p>“I like Olivia,” he says.</p>
                        <p>“Hmm,” she murmurs noncommittally, exhaling long. Jonas likes the feeling of the car beneath his back -- the cool metal, the slight curve against his shoulders. “The stars are awesome tonight,” she observes. </p>
                        <p>He looks up at the sky; she is right. What strikes him more than the stars themselves, though, is the negative indigo space between them, like ink has been poured across a piece of paper, leaving only a few white specks clean. The song ends and a new one plays. This one is softer, more melted-sounding.</p>
                        <p>“Did you know,” says Olivia, “that the lifespan of a star is determined by its mass?”</p>
                        <p>Olivia is like this: she can pull random facts from the air, startle people. Did you know that all polar bears are left-handed? That laughing strengthens the immune system? A mayfly has a lifespan of less than 24 hours, did you know that?</p>
                        <p>“Small stars can live for trillions of years, while some big stars might live for only a million.” She laughs. “Only a million. I guess that’s not a phrase you hear too often.” </p>
                        <p>They look at the sky. “Isn’t it amazing,” she says, “how slowly things change?”</p>
                        <p>He knows exactly what she means. How one day a tree outside your window is green and sun-splashed and in a month it is yellow and in another month all the leaves are fallen, only the change was so gradual that you didn’t even notice it happening. How you start playing cello when you are five and improve so slowly that it doesn’t feel like anything, and then how suddenly you look around and realize that it is how everyone knows you. How your parents are happy and love each other and then start loving each other less and less, incrementally, until one day they sit you down in the living room and say, “We’re splitting up.” And how slowly people change, too. Sisters, even. </p>
                        <p>He remembers Olivia’s graduation three years ago -- sitting with his parents in hot folding chairs while a lawn mower droned far away. He remembers watching her walk across the stage, her white robes loose and divine. He remembers thinking, that is my sister, and when they said Olivia Adams and she leaned forward to accept her diploma, he felt this same fist-in-the-stomach of feelings: admiration and jealousy and pride and nostalgia all fused into one. It was the feeling, he now realizes, of missing someone who was still there.</p>
                        <p>“Sorry if I startled you earlier,” she says. “I just, you know. I wanted to make sure you were okay.”</p>
                        <p>He swallows. “Yeah,” he said. “I’ll be okay.”</p>
                        <p>She doesn’t press. She shifts a little closer to him on the car, so that their shoulders and elbows touch. It’s nice.</p>
                        <p>“How’s college?” he asks.</p>
                        <p>“Well...” He looks at her, hair splayed on the dark blue metal, her silhouette white against the sky. For a second he sees something as if from backstage, a quick flash of something familiar in the gap between the curtains. Like something has shifted, this panel that she closed has slid out of the way for a moment. But then he blinks and she returns to herself, this new self. “It’s good. It’s okay.”</p>
                        <p>He doesn’t press either. They just look up at the stars together, and that is enough.</p>
                        <p>A car door slams across the parking lot, and they can both hear their mom’s shoes moving over the asphalt.</p>
                        <p>Olivia giggles. “Shitty shitty shit,” she whispers, and Jonas laughs too.</p>
                        <p>“Pile of shit.”</p>
                        <p>Olivia tries to straighten her face, but she bursts out into giggles again. “We should really not be laughing,” she says. “This is a very serious matter.”</p>
                        <p>“Grave,” Jonas adds. They laugh and slide off the car roof onto the ground, Olivia still holding the cup with her iPod in it. </p>
                        <p>“Kids?” their father’s voice rises over the music, loud and gruff. </p>
                        <p>Olivia snorts. “Of course,” she says. “They got here at the exact same time. What are the odds of that, I mean, really?”</p>
                        <p>“Jonas and Olivia?” their mom’s voice joins too, and Jonas is reminded again of those road trips long ago -- his parents’ voices calling his name as he surfaced slowly from his dreams.</p>
                        <p>“Mom?” Olivia calls.</p>
                        <p>“Dad?” Jonas says.</p>
                        <p>Olivia takes the iPod out of the cup and puts it in her pocket, and the music is sucked away. He can hear with perfect acuity all the noises of the night: the crickets in the trees beyond the lot, the bugs buzzing around the light from the streetlamp. Olivia breathing beside him, his mother coming over.</p>
                        <p>“Oh my god, are you guys okay?” She leans over, grips his shoulders tight. His father is a dark silhouette behind her. Then her voice changes and Jonas braces himself. “Jonas, I really can’t tell you how ang--”</p>
                        <p>“We’re fine,” Olivia interrupts. She pushes her hair behind her ears. “And Mom, Dad, please. This is totally my fault. I was talking to Jonas while he was trying to concentrate. I’m really, really sorry.”</p>
                        <p>For once, their mom looks speechless. “I...”</p>
                        <p>Jonas’s father steps forward. “It’s okay,” he says. “I’ve called for it to be towed. We’ll see how much damage there is. It’ll be fine.”</p>
                        <p>Their mom seems to collect her bearings a little. “Yes. We’ll talk about this more in the morning, but for now let’s just get home.” She turns to their father. “Can I give you a ride?”</p>
                        <p>He scratches his cheek. “Uh, sure. Thanks.”</p>
                        <p>They get into their mom’s car. Mom driving, Dad shotgun, Jonas and Olivia in the back. The streetlights blur outside Jonas’s window, smudges of white and red and green in the inky night. He leans towards Olivia, and she reaches her hand out to his shoulder, but they seem to realize at the same time that they have grown and that there isn’t enough space anymore. It is a change that has happened slowly; neither of them are surprised, really. So he settles for the dip between her shoulder and her neck, and she puts her arm around him. And as the car rumbles down the interstate, they let themselves relax.</p>

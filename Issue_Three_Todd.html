                        <p>My mother made us leave the house to get fresh air. We went to the gas station because we didn’t know how to get anywhere else and Molly didn’t have a car yet. It used to be a convenience store but Andy told us that they got cut off from their suppliers. Now, when Molly, Angie, and I go, we could only buy off-brand tea and potato chips. Five men were in line for cigarettes. Andy, who sometimes picked Molly up in his car, was working the register. I thought he was beautiful. The smell of gasoline collected on dark hairs on his neck. His veins popped out of his pasty arms. His heavy dark eyes creased around the corners when he smiled at us.</p>
                        <p>“I can’t talk, if you could just wait,” Andy said.</p>
                        <p>Andy raised his arm. At only twelve, I’d wait hours for Andy. One of the cigarette customers with his plump stomach and soft pale neck rubbed his face with one of his dirty, dried hands. My little sister, Angie’s forehead was sweaty and her hands callused and rough as she wiped the sugar from the candy we bought her onto her pants. My mother bought the pants for me but they were too small. </p>
                        <p>“Let’s just go,” Molly said.</p>
                        <p>“You heard mom, just a little time out of the house.” </p>
                        <p>Molly had yet to doubt my mother’s authority. As she leaned on the window edge, her body was curled inward. Her hair was heavy over her face and her legs crossed over each other so that the fat on her legs pressed together. I was glad she didn’t put on any makeup today. Usually, her eyes were widened and dark. The sunlight brightened her face and the haze of artificial light, like a magnet to her skin, flushed her cheeks. I thought about how she looked more like my father than the rest of us. I wondered, if eventually, I would be pretty like Molly. </p>
                        <p>“Where else are we going to go?” I asked.</p>
                        <p>“I don’t know,” Molly said. “I want to go home. I don’t care what mom thinks.”</p>
                        <p>I tugged at Angie’s arm and we sat on the shut-off metal vent by the window. Angie pressed her face against the glass and I smoothed the wrinkles of her shirt. </p>
                        <p>“I’m going outside. It’s stuffy and smells bad.” </p>
                        <p>The bell rang when Molly left. Another of the cigarette customers with younger wide eyes and a loose thin t-shirt watched her through the glass. I wondered that if I got in line, whether Andy would give me a package of cigarettes. There was no one else at the gas station around our age. The only woman was hushing her husband. She held her pudgy wrists with her thick hands. Her husband’s tattoo gleamed next to the blue and tan of beer cans. </p>
                        <p>“How have you guys been?” Andy asked.</p>
                        <p>Andy leaned his body over the empty counter and I tried to get closer to him. The cigarette men had left. </p>
                        <p>“Fine,” I said, “just taking a walk around the neighborhood. We thought we might visit.” </p>
                        <p>I pulled Angie up by her arm. </p>
                        <p>“I’m doing well. Your mom still baking extra-large cookies?” Andy asked. “I remember those from last time I came for Molly.” </p>
                        <p>Angie grabbed the edge of the counter and smeared the dust around. </p>
                        <p>“The house is burning up in baking fumes,” I said. </p>
                        <p>I dropped the few remaining coins I brought into the tip bowl. Andy smiled and spit slid around the top of his retainer. </p>
                        <p>“Ah, I see,” Andy said. “The three of you are cooling off.”</p>
                        <p>“Molly in particular.” </p>
                        <p>Andy leaned his body forward to avoid the glare of the sun and to see Molly. She was sitting cross-legged on the ground. The grass that poked through the cracks in the sidewalk rubbed against her bare-freckled skin. I hoped he would notice our similarities.</p>
                        <p>“Is your family going to the history fair?” I asked Andy. </p>
                        <p>“Don’t know.” </p>
                        <p>“We’re going. My history teacher is giving us extra credit if we go,” I said. “We’re studying it right now. It’s also dad’s favorite.” </p>
                        <p>My father would sit around the dinner table and tell us stories about the town.  He’d always begin with the buildings: the State Theater and the factories first and then the arcade and the downtown shopping center. He would tighten up his face and say, “And now look at it? Ugly cement buildings. It’s truly a shame; even in the 50’s, this place was a beauty.”</p>
                        <p>At the fair, a display of our town’s history in the form of vignettes lines the old road: silicon and metal men in suits and women in wax dresses who as the years go on curve and thin out. When I was alone, I thought about the metal men who watched us destroy and rebuild their buildings. Dad says, Charles Acker, the richest man in town, gave his sons the tallest building in town to make something of themselves. I imagined he thought about them driving forward but it seems people left in the same way people came. </p>
                        <p>The bell on the door rang and fresh air fluttered my jacket sleeves. Andy shifted his body away from us. Molly was uprooting pebbles lodged in the cracks in the sidewalk. The men who walked in didn’t look at us. They opened and closed cooler doors while Angie jumped and tried to lift herself onto the counter. I clenched my knees together and Andy’s face turned away. The three of us floated in the men’s plaster smell and the sound of their mouth breathing and their scratchy shirt fabric. </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>“You glad to be back in school?” Andy asked.</p>
                        <p>“Yeah, it’s been okay,” I told him. “How do you like high school?”</p>
                        <p>“It’s fine. I like the sports. Classes are hard.” </p>
                        <p>I wondered if Andy looked at me the way people look at Molly around town. She radiated as if she is actually doing something.</p>
                        <p>“Seventh grade, right?” Andy said. </p>
                        <p>I nodded my head and the fringe of my hair brushed my cheeks. </p>
                        <p>“Do you have Mr. Beumers? He hated me.” </p>
                        <p>“No. Is he a social studies teacher?” </p>
                        <p>“No, he was my science teacher,” Andy told me. “I’ll just be happy when I’m done with school.”</p>
                        <p>I laughed, asked, “Will you give me a cigarette?”</p>
                        <p>Andy’s eyes took on a tired look in this light. </p>
                        <p>“I don’t think I can do that,” he said.</p>
                        <p>“How about a beer?” I asked. “Couldn’t you take me for a ride in your car?” </p>
                        <p>He stared, “Gum. You should be happy with this.” </p>
                        <p>I took the gum and stared up at Andy. I couldn’t really tell exactly what color his eyes were but I did see where his arm was bruised from sports and his hair oily. </p>
                        <p>“I think we’ll be heading home,” I said. </p>
                        <p>He waved us off. Molly stood up when she heard the bell. I thought she recognized the sound of our feet. Angie only wore maryjanes with glitter. My feet were dirty. Molly rubbed her lips together and they became wet with her spit. </p>
                        <p>“We going home?” Molly asked.</p>
                        <p>“No,” I said. </p>
                        <p>“Where are we going to go?”</p>
                        <p>“I don’t know,” I said. “Dad says he always used to go to the theater.” </p>
                        <p>“What theater?” </p>
                        <p>Molly’s nostrils flared and, like Andy, she started talking to me like I was a child. </p>
                        <p>“Did you know that downtown there used to be ten or more theaters?” I told her. </p>
                        <p>“No, I didn’t know that.” </p>
                        <p>“They tore them down or were abandoned,” I said. “Ms. Corey told me that. There used to be so much to do.”</p>
                        <p>Molly started walking away. I liked to think she has the look of someone from the past—maybe Harry Demint from the handout. A rough, free spirited, and warmhearted frontiersmen, together with his two friends he built a log cabin and planned a town. They built the cabin themselves, even their wives stayed back. Mr. Foos was the first to get his family; I liked to think my father is the most like him out of the three. </p>
                        <p>“Molly, don’t go home yet,” I said.</p>
                        <p>I dragged Angie behind me to catch Molly around the corner.  Her hair flew behind her like a veil. Angie had taken to the habit of dragging her feet and the glitter on her shoes left a trail behind us. </p>
                        <p>“I’m tired,” Molly said. </p>
                        <p>Angie and I had caught up to her. She was swinging her arms and her fingertips grazed her shorts’ hem. In my mind, Molly didn’t have an intermediate phase. She was a child with fat on her neck and around her wrists and she smelled like dandelions and milk. The other Molly was taller than me. She straightened her hair so it emitted electrical burning smells. The fat fell off in chucks in the shower next to the dark hairs in the drain. She stayed in this phase the longest. I rubbed my own legs together and the hairs that scratch bare skin mesh together. </p>
                        <p>“I’m going home,” Molly said. “I’m tired and I’m going home.” </p>
                        <p>I pushed Angie forward so she could clamp her pink-sugared hands onto Molly’s blouse.  When I think about why I didn’t follow them, a lot of reasons come to mind. It may be the way they both fit into the background. Molly’s hair was blowing around her face and looked like the leaves. Angie’s smeared face and muddied calves melted into the sidewalk. For the first time, I didn’t want to be Molly. I didn’t want to go home or stay still.</p>

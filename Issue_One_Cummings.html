                        <p>It was you who found the skeleton, on that hazy July day when I was wearing my old undershirt and watering the begonias in the front garden. You had crawled on your hands and knees under the porch—you were still small then, and no nook or cranny was safe. I was trying to salvage my wilted flowers, and wasn’t paying much attention. It all seemed harmless, anyway. Maybe I had thought you were searching for shade under those moldering wooden boards. But now I realize, it was only you, wasn’t it? Hard at work, searching for neat odd bits forgotten by time. I was tilting a watering can, ready to pour, and didn’t hear your first scream.</p>
                        <p>The second one rattled the front awning. It sent Harvey pelting out through the open door, barking in harmony. My father’s heart was still young then, and it started pumping fast. You were only a pair of little tanned legs wrapped in a floral sundress, sticking out like a crooked bouquet. When I pulled these out, the rest of you came with them, kicking and flailing. Your heart was fluttering like a parakeet’s as I took you into my arms. You flapped wildly, wormed into my shoulder, burying your eyes away from the sun. Harvey reared and pressed his paws against my leg. I ran my hands up and down your head, checking wildly for blood, bruises. There were none.</p>
                        <p>“There, down there,” you gulped, shuddering. “It’s rotted, I don’t want to look at it.”</p>
                        <p>I still had soil on my hands; it was leaving rich dark smears on the back of your dress. Carefully, I lowered you—onto grass, so you didn’t burn your feet on the pavement. You clung to my waist as I peered into the gloom. I saw the shape there, slumped far back. The air was moist and subterranean down there against the bowels of our house.</p>
                        <p>In life, it had been a squirrel. Or at least it looked that way. Putrefaction had scattered its bones, but the yawning cavity of the skull seemed about the right size. Thank god you had been spared seeing it unravel there in the darkness. Any talk of rot had come from your imagination alone: the bones were unadorned. Only a few diffident, clinging tufts of gray fur hinted that there had been a squirrel lying here once, sightless. These bones had once been hung with meat, with nerves, with twitching veins, but they had all run like rancid cheese in the summer heat. A swarm of engorged black flies drifted in low, lazy orbits around the yellowing bones, sated, their feast over and done.</p>
                        <p>I felt you tug on my pant leg. “Is it dead?” Your voice was watery.</p>
                        <p>“Yeah.” I let my hand envelop yours. “Of course it is. Don’t worry, I’ll go get a garbage bag and clean it up.”</p>
                        <p>You stood quietly. When I grinned at you, you didn’t look back.</p>
                        <p>“It’s dead, honey,” I said firmly. “It can’t hurt you.” A brief nod. I knew this was all I would get.</p>
                        <p>There was no more exploring that day. You clung to my waist as I puttered around the kitchen, searching for a garbage bag. I served your favorite mac and cheese that night, and you picked at your bowl. At night, I heard you tossing in your sheets one room over.</p>
                        <p>Of course these things pass. Summertime helps them fade away better than anything I know. You found new places to plumb for adventure—even climbed the big oak tree in the backyard. I still have a picture of you up there. We watched movies together, unless we fell asleep. Harvey went to the vet for a tick. I managed, against staggering odds, to save my begonias.</p>
                        <p>But you never went under the porch again. I don’t know how many times I assured you I had scooped up the bones, how they had come apart in my hands like wet paper, an impotent afterthought to life. I told you I had removed them, but I knew their presence still lingered down there below the boards. You kept those bones long after I threw them away.</p>
                        <p>For all I know, you still have them. Maybe when I am ninety and lying in hospice care—all the life dripping out of me and replaced by formaldehyde or whatever the hell they keep in those IV bags—you’ll see my wasted skin stretched over my skeleton and think of flies feasting, see my shrunken eyes and think of hollow black sockets in the dark, white like wax and filled with life turned sour, all the summer drained out of us both.</p>

                        <p>Mad melted, and she felt it fully. In the harsh shadows, in the upward sticks, in the barrenness, in the bright night. In the housed rows, in the barbed wires, in the horse ghosts. In the former stables, in the painted white walls. In the one bed in her family’s camp room, she was shivering, feverish, and melting. Her neck was heavier, and her feet were pointed. The grown-ups all believed that the fever Mad developed from her own throat would have escaped to the others by now, but it hadn’t, and they were thankful. Because Mad’s fever was hers and only hers. It had been there for weeks, as she lay shivering shining and shaking in her family’s only bed in the former stables in the blank rows in the bright night contained by the upward sticks and faceless men.</p>
                        <p>Mad was melting, and she heard the door open, but she was shivering too quietly to move. But as the wind moved closer, she felt it morph kindly. The wind crawled into bed and she felt it breathing slow into her neck, whistling through its nose. Then the wind dripped. It rained on the back of her neck until she was no longer melting, feverish, or shivering. Until she had drifted calmly into a place where the sun rose, where the houses were dispersed against each other and nothing was ordered and perfect.</p>
                        <p>And more, she felt the wind drift with her.</p>
                        <center>***</center>
                        <br>
                        <p>The next day, the cafeteria buzzed as Mad walked in with her hair spread down her long back. She glowed, suddenly, alive. Overnight, they whispered. Sean came back last night, they said, and Mad was healed. He came back, they said, on one leg. Some were old and still remembering but not retelling their stories of the motherland, and instead, played with the young Nisei fingers of their children’s children. Some were buck-toothed like the rats on the posters that were pasted in magazines, in newspapers, on the walls of their past-homes, in the warmer days before the internment. Some, the youngest, were unaware, happy to be with their friends and un-curious of what lay beyond the triple-layered barbed wire walls. But none had their hair loose and loud as Mad’s, as she drifted into the cafeteria half-asleep and half-alive. And the presence of Sean, who had finally come back after three years in the war, silenced the small world. He was the first son to come back, though on one leg, and everyone was curious, and even more curious because Mad was walking now by his overnight touch and she was blushing and flushing now, as alive as she ever looked.</p>
                        <p>They didn’t talk about a twisted-up leg and ignored the way it twisted. “You were sick long?” he asked.</p>
                        <p>“A week.”</p>
                        <p>“Not terrible.”</p>
                        <p>“You’re back,” Mad said, sifting.</p>
                        <p>“You knew I was coming. I wrote about it, didn’t you know?”</p>
                        <p>“But you’re here now.” They walked along the edges of the camp, careful not to touch the wire and not to take their steps too fast. Mad heard, even in her fever, her parents talking about the camp in Oregon, where the faceless men fired shots at an old rat retrieving a ball for his grandson from over the fences. But today the men saluted Sean, the first boy home from the war. They saw Sean and Mad, and instead, averted their eyes.</p>
                        <p>“When you came back, how was Dad?”</p>
                        <p>“He was fine.”</p>
                        <p>“And you. How are you?”</p>
                        <p>“Good, Mad.” Sean cleared his throat. He inhaled slowly like an expansion, and then deflated as he touched her shoulder. “You’ve recovered for a morning and you’re already asking questions.”</p>
                        <p> She noticed, then, the grayness of the air, how it pressed against Sean’s face. His face had hardened and wrinkled, and his eyes now furrowed upwards. She looked at his leg, really looked at it, at how it remained dead on his body. Then, she looked at his chest that had turned too broad for his ghost of a body, that enveloped the rest. “How do you like being back?” she asked.</p>
                        <p> Sean kicked at the ground with a crutch, his movements, to Mad, unbearably lopsided. “Everything’s the same. After everything else, everything’s the same.”</p>
                        <p> It wasn’t just Mad who couldn’t place Sean, because Sean—who took walks around the perimeter on his new three legs, opened doors for old women, watched the ten-year-old boys hit balls with their cardboard bats into makeshift baseball rings, smiled waywardly, refused to talk about himself, worked studiously for his parents, and didn’t look at you when you spoke—confounded everyone. But the people were not ones who would address the confusion outright. It was sensed more implicitly. In the question of touch, in the inability of the children who typically asked anything that came to mind to approach his dried leg, in the faceless men’s salute while Sean walked past, in how Sean’s eyes seemed to drift when spoken to so that all conversation evaporated. Even their mother could only talk to him through her hands. One finger on his shoulder, another on his arm. And each time, her touches only caused the emptiness in his eyes to become more apparent as the hours on the porch flipped and turned, so that even a mother’s touch had its small helpless limits.</p>
                        <p> Mad and the others remembered, instead, the golden afternoon nearly two years ago, the last time Sean had been placed, when the spring had flowed into some semblance of living, and each family whispered as their sons disappeared through the gates one by one like exhales. The fathers had watched with fear and envy. A strange combination that unsettled. They understood the weight of their son’s bodies, but they were jealous of what they could see. Release. Trees of beautiful full leaves. Songs of hungry liberty that birds sang right before their deaths. The women had convinced the workers that it was necessary for them, for once, to cook for their sons a final time. Mad’s father had sat with Sean on the floor of their flat, cross-legged and solemn. And it was there where he had said that Sean’s honor would be death, though he prayed not, it could only be so—that even though life in the camp was uneventful, it was the very quiet that could tear men to tears and skeleton. And that service was a matter of death, even more for Sean than for the Uncle Sam’s and the Betty’s and the Hemingway’s. The soldiers of our past, his father reminded him, killed themselves when the battle was over, so there was nothing left to say. Do not be afraid of this form of honor.</p>
                        <p> Some boys came back in letters. Some came back in inscriptions, in medals, in apologies. But only Sean came back three-legged, one untwisted and two new to replace the remembered. Sean came back breathing and talking, holding doors for women, retrieving balls for boys. Sean came back alive and undeniably so, and no one had prepared for that. Not even Mad.</p>
                        <center>***</center>
                        <br>
                        <p> After school, Mad rushed away like silk to her spot under a tree and over the slim hills. She saw past the faceless men. Here, she could see the fathers rowing on the flat land, planting and sweating, and here, she could see how wicked the soil was and how little it responded to the men. She could see the boys’ baseball game and how they dotted the fields like poppies. The barber buildings, the mess halls, the outhouses. She attempted to see past the barbed wire on the other side of the camp, but the soil on the other side seemed no kinder, only menacing. It was the emptiness. The land held no air. There was no world beyond it. But still, the sky was blue and the wind wheezed and the grass looked green against her palms, so she lay on the ground, seeping any small whisper of beauty into her understanding.</p>
                        <p> While she seeped, she heard footsteps and saw the tall sturdy shadow of Timmy kiss the tips of her third finger on the grass. She’d known Timmy for years, but only over the past year had he grown beautiful to her and had she grown beautiful to him. He seemed to know things that no one else knew. How to steal a jazz record from a faceless man’s cabin. How to swing his leg around the music like a parent’s tale. How to touch Mad’s neck to it. Mad shifted onto her stomach while he knelt down and they met each other nose-to-nose and sweet.</p>
                        <p> “Feeling better from last week?” he asked.</p>
                        <p> “Yes.” She leaned cream-soft against his shoulder. “Sean’s back, did you hear?”</p>
                        <p> “Who hasn’t?” He took out a disc from his bag. “I wish we had some record player.” He slid the meat of his finger along the slicked edge. “There’s no use without one.” He seemed to forget that he was the one who made the effort to sneak into the cabin, flick through the records, step unnaturally softly, and take Duke Ellington. The disc flattened in the camp wind. He picked up the strands of hair on her shoulder. “You look good,” he said.</p>
                        <p> She tangled her fingers over his. “You do too.” He breathed gently into her neck and she giggled. He cooled her lips in a whisper, a hum, while she sang back with her eyes closed so softly, like the clouds that sometimes lifted over the camp on good days. It felt good, again, to melt. She missed how his back curved and how light his fingers felt against her ears.</p>
                        <p>A step. Timmy pushed her face to his chest and she kept it there. Another. Some mumbles. Leaf crackles. More. Louder voices. “You’re the Jap that takes my discs, huh?” a voice said. Timmy quickened the way his hands brushed through Mad’s hair. “Answer me. You’re the Jap, aren’t you?”</p>
                        <p>“Yes sir.”</p>
                        <p>“You shouldn’t be here. This place is restricted.”</p>
                        <p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
                        <p>When the voice finally made its way to the other side of the tree, it laughed. “With a girl, huh?” he said. “So sweet.”</p>
                        <p>“I’m sorry, sir.”</p>
                        <p>“None of you should be here. I’ll take you back to camp.” Mad unfolded from him and they both stood up, cracked their bones, and glanced at each other. “You,” the faceless man said, gripping Timmy’s elbow, “come with me. You,” he said, nodding at Mad, “follow. And don’t come here again.” He dragged Timmy back to camp while Mad followed and the camp—its straight barracks, its crowds, its grayness, its broken saplings—impended closer and closer.</p>
                        <p>The man dragged Timmy to his cabin and Mad heard the door click to a lock. She pressed her ear against it but heard nothing and decided to ask Timmy about it later, though her chest sunk low. She made her way to an outhouse instead, and shivered at the stench of stale-fresh shit, but what shook her more, as she waited in a stretching line, was the number of women who watched, as she did, patiently as their to-be predecessors produced slick ribbons of piss. When it was her turn, she observed the worms at the bottom of the ditch gleam over themselves and twist under each other, free to move. How strange they looked, thriving. How strange and how familiar.</p>
                        <center>***</center>
                        <br>
                        <p>Slowly the days and the secrets let loose, how slow, through the walls, Sean’s secrets. When he came back, he found only the company of the oldest women to be tolerable, and they were flattered to have him, though only on one leg, handsome and young and attentive. Their age made them understanding, their speech tinged with tragedy. Because they had lived through so much aliveness—the coming of colored Western goods in Meiji markets, cherry blossom trees, steaming kettles of fish and mother’s soup, waving sailors under bridges. And here, the barren, the barracks, the brass eyes of the faceless men always on everyone always and forever. They understood.</p>
                        <p>One time at midnight, Mad lay awake on the floor, pretending to be asleep, next to her parents who were feigning snores, and an absent Sean, when suddenly, she heard his voice emerge from between the thin walls. Loud like she had always remembered before he came back. Her parents stopped snoring, and their small room inhaled and held in its movements, sucking in Sean’s words.</p>
                        <p>In Cat Island, there were dogs. Yellow dogs, big dogs, black dogs, skinny dogs, small itty dogs, awful dogs, hairy dogs, furry dogs. We came off the plane and onto a boat, and then, we waited, doing nothing, all twenty-five of us, waiting for something. All we heard was secret. We were part of something secret, something big, and we could not talk about it we didn’t know what it was. They put the dogs next to us one day, smiling dog slobbering dog panting dog like how the dogs used to be smiling and slobbering and panting. Then they tell the dogs to kill us, so we watch the dogs charge at us, and they run to us smiling and slobbering and panting. They tell us to fall down after they tell the dogs to kill us. I don’t fall down, but they push me, and the dog bites me big dog furry dog slobbering dog. They say kill them and the dog bites me and I fall down and the dog bites me and I fall down and the dog bites me and I fall. Then they look at me and tell me to hit them, so I hit the big dog furry dog until it bleeds and even when its back fur turns red I hit the dog and hit it. Then it bites and bites and doesn’t let go, not until they tell it to stop. They bring the dog away and I still see the big dog furry dog hurting and I feel tired and terrible about its blood. One day they put me in a box. They put me with a pistol. And they say kill him! so they come and they bite me and they bite me but they don’t say stop so the dogs bite and bite until I am too tired to stand, so I fall and then they say stop. So many dogs. So many many dogs.</p>
                        <p>Why? the women asked.</p>
                        <p>They think the Japanese smell different. The dogs can smell the difference, they think. So then the dogs can smell the Japanese, and they can say kill them and the dogs will bite and bite until the Japanese fall down.</p>
                        <p>Mad heard silence. <i>Why is Sean talking about this</i> her father asked her mother <i>doesn’t he know everyone can hear through these walls? That the guards can hear too?</i> But she drifted and dreamt feverishly. Timmy was locked in the faceless man’s room and was there a dog? Were there many? And did the faceless man say kill him! and the faceless dogs run at him and bite him bite him bite him until he fell? And was that why when Mad had asked him the day after, he had only shook his head, then kissed her forehead long, and light, and sad?</p>
                        <center>***</center>
                        <br>
                        <p>To be <i>and</i>. It was 1945 now, and two years ago, before the boys shuffled out like exhales, the question ripped the camp. And. The faceless men distributed the questionnaires to separate the loyal from the disloyal. And. It was August now, burning hot and humid and awful because the land had no wind, but it had been February then, cold and dry. There had been no snow that year. And. Mad remembered little from before and not very much from after. And. Out of the long pages of questions, there were only, really, two. And. Will you swear? it asked. Will you swear unqualified allegiance to the United States of America, and forswear any allegiance or obedience to the Japanese emperor? The questionnaire came from something outside, a big word like government. A damned if you do, damned if you don’t type of thing. Will you swear and forswear when there was nothing to foreswear? Or would you not swear what you already believed to forswear what had never happened? If yes, you had been disloyal. If no, you were going to. And. Mad remembered how it ripped up the camp and tore the families into two camps, one saying yes and one saying no. No one questioned the words, and no one would approach the faceless men for clarification. Yes, because of. No, because of. Mad’s father and Timmy’s father said yes because of, because they wanted future not history, because they were American whatever that entailed, because they needed to be trusted, because people treated others based on potential and less on history. Sam’s and Lucy’s and Amelia’s fathers said no because of, because it was wrong, the question was wrong, the assumption was wrong, the answer would always be wrong.</p>
                        <p>So Sam, Lucy, and Amelia left the camp one afternoon, got placed in Tule Lake, away from the rest, and were never seen again. Yes, no. And. Because of. That was all.</p>
                        <p>It was early early August, the first or the second day. It was 1945. The war may not have been over. But out of the line of the dead, Sean was back, letters were sent, and the country was kind to let them live.</p>
                        <center>***</center>
                        <br>
                        <p>The faceless men herded the rats to the center of the camp, turned on the radio, and waited for the buzzing of too many bodies to dissipate. In the burning of August, the rush of children mixed with the slap of women and the waves of men, and Mad melted, again, into the outstanding sun-lilting light of the crowd. Truman addressed true men, he said, and in doing so, he praised a powerful and forceful influence towards the maintenance of world peace. The bomb had been detonated! this rain of ruin from the air! in phrases slick like poetry, which had never before been seen on earth! His voice held so much triumph, that when the faceless men turned off the radio, the crowd of rats was left silent and unsure, gnawing jittery but quiet. His voice had been so lovely and pleasant. And the radio, how sweet it sounded, the crackle like the crust of bread, reminding them the outside world was real and moving, that life lived without them.</p>
                        <p>The men talked in their rooms. They detonated the bomb on Japan? Good! Good! The war would be over, maybe, the other sons would come back without a left leg like Sean or a right leg or an arm or something even greater, but they would be here. And they would finally get out of this camp, maybe, if the country was kind enough, and back onto their streets like Baker Maple Sycamore Main or Wilson. If the country was kind enough! They would leave the camps forever and never look back, and live on and live on and live on, because now the Japs were weakened and the country would stop questioning them, with questions of only and and these outhouses and these thin thin walls. How liberating! How wonderful, that the war was finally over.</p>
                        <p>At night, while Mad feigned sleep, and her father embraced her mother and promised her freedom, dresses, a house, and loud love, she leaned against the wall and heard, instead, a murmur in the next room, where Sean and his group of the oldest women stayed. Who knew what the rain of ruin was. She heard, instead, wordless weeping, a chorus so strong and saturated that she crumbled as well into something tight, and hid her wailings from her parents, who slept soundlessly next to her.</p>

                        <br>
                        <p>Mad found herself, yet again, at her spot over the slim hills, regardless of the faceless men who also sensed that their hold was weakening and began to laugh weakly. To take off their masks, their sticks. It was strange watching the faceless smile. No one knew, without mouths, that they were capable.</p>
                        <p>“Hi Mad,” she heard from behind the tree. She looked around and saw Timmy. He held discs and a newspaper in his hands.</p>
                        <p>“Won’t he notice if you take more than one?” Timmy shrugged.</p>
                        <p>“They’re useless without a record player.”</p>
                        <p>Mad smiled softly. “Why do you take them if they’re so useless?”</p>
                        <p>“I got a newspaper today too. Look at this,” he said. He read, “The bomb is brighter and stronger than the sun. It is the future of warfare. Brutal, dangerous. It will guarantee peace with the feasibility of only two options: life or death.”</p>
                        <p>“Stop reading,” Mad said. “It’s over.”</p>
                        <p>“Okay,” Timmy said, crumbling the newspaper. He threw it down the hill and they watched it land in a ditch an unimpressive feet away. “Where are you going after this?”</p>
                        <p>She stilled. They’d known each other for years but never asked about the before and never thought about the after. “Los Angeles.”</p>
                        <p>“Oregon.”</p>
                        <p>“God,” Mad said. “God.”</p>
                        <p>“It will be strange, going back. We hired a squatter. You?”</p>
                        <p>“I don’t know.”</p>
                        <p>He tucked her hair behind her ear and touched her where her earlobe met her jaw. “What will we do, Mad? What do you think?”</p>
                        <p>Mad thought about before. A tiny sliver of a girl. How blue the sky looked, how the candy store brought tufts of taffy, how the children skipped. She thought about the streets and the bright ground of Los Angeles, and the bridges, and the purple. She thought about her house, solitary and yellow. “I’m going to live,” she said. “I’ll forget some things, but mostly, I’m going to live.”</p>

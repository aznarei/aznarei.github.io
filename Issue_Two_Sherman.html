                    </center>
                    <br>
                    <p class="text-left" style="min-width:800px">
                        <p>Underneath Annabelle's somber eyes and ghostly skin, she was lovely. Her small smiles were infectious in a way that went unnoticed; she was a good kid, the best half-sister anyone could have.</p>
                        <p>“Why is life so awful,” she moaned, letting her head fall backwards.</p>
                        <p>“Because Clue isn’t much fun with two players,” I told her. She sat across from me, leaning over with her hands gripping the edge of her seat. As she stared at the board with her distant gray eyes, it was hard to believe she was turning thirteen in a couple month.</p>
                        <p>“Clue isn’t fun. Period,” she pouted. I laughed; she did too.</p>
                        <p>Vietnam traveled through the radios and televisions and clung to the American air. Still, no one could completely fathom the chaos five-thousand miles away, let alone in our backyards. We were unaware.</p>
                        <p>The doorknob suddenly jiggled. Daw was home.</p>
                        <p>Fiddling with a pocket knife, he stepped into the kitchen, a restlessness dispersing into the air with every footstep. Our muscles tensed.</p>
                        <p>“Hey, kiddos,” he said grandly, before directing his attention to Annabelle. She was Daw’s first and only child, and her youth was enticing. He nudged his head towards the back door. “Let’s go for a walk.” I think it scared the hell out of her.</p>
                        <p>Annabelle smiled. Her eyes continued to look down at the board.</p>
                        <p>“We’re playing Clue—,” she started. Daw grinned. His yellow-teeth were disgusting.</p>
                        <p>“I really think we should go for a walk.”</p>
                        <p>They shouldn’t. Walks were always bad.</p>
                        <p>I glanced at Annabelle uneasily, but then pulled back when I saw her playing with the black beaded necklace Daw had gifted her last Valentine’s Day.</p>
                        <p>I looked away.</p>
                        <p>Flicking the plastic figurine of a revolver across the board, I said, “Guess we’re done then.” She pursed her lips and nodded her head before getting up. Daw lent out a hand, and she took it. Side by side, they silently shuffled outside.</p>
                        <p>As I put away the board game, I noticed the faint war reports of the radio on the kitchen window-sill. I glanced past the radio and saw Annabelle walking down the street in her oversized nightgown and off-white ballerina slippers with her right hand intertwined with Daw’s. I wondered if the neighbors ever noticed or if it had become all too ordinary.</p>
                        <p>The coming months of Vietnam would sweep us off our feet.</p>
                        <center>***</center>
                        <br>
                        <p>During the time Daw lived with our family, he carried a small, camouflage pouch by his hip. He kept his pocket-knives inside of it. I would awake to Daw restlessly marching around the house with one of the knives. The radio would blast monotonous newscasters voices, reporting the war with the rise of the morning sun.</p>
                        <p>“I’m gonna show ‘em a real fighter,” he would smirk, tapping me violently against the chest, when I walked into the kitchen. As a new enlistee for the war, Daw’s spirit seemed unbreakable compared to the rest of the country. “Something that comes from inside, and I have it,” he would continue, with a mischievous glimmer. His eyes would dart around the room until they were looking straight into mine. “You have it, too.” Boy, I didn’t want to have it.</p>
                        <p>Yet, I never could summon the courage to shake my head. If I did, he would playfully drag the switchblade under my chin. “You have it,” he would repeat as if he were trying to turn an eighteen year-old boy into a man with the tickle of a knife. I always swallowed my defiance and pressed it deep into the pit of my stomach.</p>
